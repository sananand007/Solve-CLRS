## Insertion sort

The outer loop runs over all the elements except the first one, because the single-element prefix A[0:1] is trivially sorted, so the invariant that the first i+1 entries are sorted is true from the start. The inner loop moves element A[i] to its correct place so that after the loop, the first i+2 elements are sorted.

```c++
  int Insertionsort(/* arguments */) {
    // Assuming the index starts from 0

    for (i = 1; i < len(A); i++) {

      key = A[j] // store the data to swap
      j = i-1

      // Note: Always use j in the j loop only
      while (j>=0 and A[j]>key) {
      // swap here
        A[j+1] = A[j]
        j = j-1
      }
      A[j+1] = key
    }
    return 0;
  }
```      

## Method of Loop Invariants

- initialization
- Maintenance
- Termination

  - Insertion sort

        The in-dex j indicates the “current card” being inserted into the hand. At the beginning
        of each iteration of the for loop, which is indexed by j , the subarray consisting
        of elements A[1 .. j-1] constitutes the currently sorted hand, and the remaining
        subarray A[j+1 .. n] corresponds to the pile of cards still on the table.
        In fact, elements A[1.. j-1] are the elements originally in positions 1 through j-1,but
        now in sorted order. We state these properties of A[1..j-1] formally as a loop invariant
  - Logic of Loop invariant:
        At the start of each iteration of the for loop of lines 1–8, the subarray
        A[1 .. j-1] consists of the elements **originally** in A[1 .. j-1], but in sorted order.
  - Some really interesting Pseusdocode concepts are covered for Pseusdocode conventions to go over
