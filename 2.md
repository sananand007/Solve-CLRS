## Loop Invariants
  - Insertion sort

          The in-dex j indicates the “current card” being inserted into the hand. At the beginning
        of each iteration of the for loop, which is indexed by j , the subarray consisting
        of elements A[1 .. j-1] constitutes the currently sorted hand, and the remaining
        subarray A[j+1 .. n] corresponds to the pile of cards still on the table.
        In fact, elements A[1.. j-1] are the elements originally in positions 1 through j-1,but
        now in sorted order. We state these properties of A[1..j-1] formally as a loop invariant
  - Logic of Loop invariant:
        At the start of each iteration of the for loop of lines 1–8, the subarray
        A[1 .. j-1] consists of the elements **originally** in A[1 .. j-1], but in sorted order.

**1.1-1**
Give a real-world example that requires sorting or a real-world example that requires computing a convex hull.

**`Answer`**
>During Fencing of a set of animals, you would need to create a convex hull. A convex hull is the smallest convex polygon containing the points. Intuitively, the convex hull is what you get by driving a nail into the plane at each point
and then wrapping a piece of string around the nails. More formally, the convex hull is the smallest
convex polygon containing the points.
