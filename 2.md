## Insertion sort

The outer loop runs over all the elements except the first one, because the single-element prefix A[0:1] is trivially sorted, so the invariant that the first i+1 entries are sorted is true from the start. The inner loop moves element A[i] to its correct place so that after the loop, the first i+2 elements are sorted.

```c++
  int Insertionsort(/* arguments */) {
    // Assuming the index starts from 0

    for (i = 1; i < len(A); i++) {

      key = A[j] // store the data to swap
      j = i-1

      // Note: Always use j in the j loop only
      while (j>=0 and A[j]>key) {
      // swap here
        A[j+1] = A[j]
        j = j-1
      }
      A[j+1] = key
    }
    return 0;
  }
```      

## Method of Loop Invariants

- initialization
- Maintenance
- Termination

  - Insertion sort

        The in-dex j indicates the “current card” being inserted into the hand. At the beginning
        of each iteration of the for loop, which is indexed by j , the subarray consisting
        of elements A[1 .. j-1] constitutes the currently sorted hand, and the remaining
        subarray A[j+1 .. n] corresponds to the pile of cards still on the table.
        In fact, elements A[1.. j-1] are the elements originally in positions 1 through j-1,but
        now in sorted order. We state these properties of A[1..j-1] formally as a loop invariant
  - Logic of Loop invariant:
        At the start of each iteration of the for loop of lines 1–8, the subarray
        A[1 .. j-1] consists of the elements **originally** in A[1 .. j-1], but in sorted order.

**2.1-3** Linear search Pseusdocode

    Before the start of the loop itself or 1st iteration , the value of index is NIL and after each iteration if the value v
    is not found then the value will still be NIL , and if the loop finishes the value at Termination will be also NIL
    This validates the principles of the Algorithm to hold true at every level

```C++
  //you have a value v to find using linear Search
  i = NIL
  for i = 0 to length(A) do
    if (A[i] == v) then
      return i
    end if
  end for    
  return NIL

```

 + Assuming A and B already contain binary digits and I am not doing any addition , as any kind of addition will only be with integers
 + Alternative solution also there, where we can consider integer addition and then mod
```C++
  carry = 0

    if (A[n-i-1] == 1) and (B[n-i-1] == 1) then
      if (carry == 0) then
        c[n-i] = 1
        carry = 0

        carry = 1

    end if

  - Running time and Size of input(n) are very important parameters
  - The running time of an algorithm on a particular input is the number of primitive operations or “steps” executed.
  - Finding the cost of executing all the instructions for insertion sort, by assigning a cost to each statement
  - Typically for insertion sort the running time of the algorithm is fixed for a given input, there are randomized algorithms, whose behavior changes even with fixed input
  - The average case running time , is sometimes as bad as the worst case scenario, suppose you run insertion sort for half the time, ie, half of the array is sorted (for this case , t = j/2), even that will result in an^2 ie, quadratic order, as for the case of worst case running scenario
  - **rate of growth/ order of growth** - for the quadratic equation, we only consider the leading term
    + We usually consider one algorithm to be efficient , if it has a running time has higher order of growth will take less time for small inputs than an algorithm which has lower order of growth
    + Considering the worst case scenario, a lower order term will always run faster than a higher order term

**`Answer`**

  + T(n) = (c1+c2+c3+c4+c5+c6)n + order(n2)
  + Best case and worst case are similar as we have to enter and compare every element
  + The only time that could be saved from worst case scenario is when swap does not occur, as the value i is not changed
  + This could still be a binomial problem
      p - probability of every element to be the one to be looked for
      k - number of times it needs to be searched for

      Considering linear search algorithm :

      Since the probability of v = A[i] is 1/n for all i = 1, . . . , n, and we need to check exactly i elements when v = A[i], we have that expected value of the number of checks is (1/n)[1+2+3...+n] = n(n+1)/2
      In the worst case it is n. The average case running time is c.[(n+1)/2] = Θ(n) since for all n ≥ 1 , we have [1/2n, n] The worst case running time is also Θ(n).

      The average case and the worst case T(n) order are both Θ(n).

      (1-p)^(A.length()) + Summation[1,n-1](k*(1-p)^(k-1) * p^(k))

        min = j           | t(j) Summation[i+1, n]
      end if
    end for(j)      
    A[i] = A[min]         | c5(n)
    A[min] = temp         | c6(n)
  end for(i)
```

**2.1-2 | 2.1-4**

**`Answer`**

The Only way we can modify the algorithm to have a best case running time are:

   + If the algorithm is very close or at the point of its purpose/solution , For ex, for a increasing sort , it is already ascending order sorted and so on .
   + If we hardcode the algorithm and output and exit for its purpose only hence forcing multiple nested loops to be just one


 ## Divide and Conquer | Merge sort

    Divide: Divide the n-element sequence to be sorted into two subsequences of n/2 elements each.
    Conquer: Sort the two subsequences recursively using merge sort.
    Combine: Merge the two sorted subsequences to produce the sorted answer.


```C++
  // This is the MERGE Procedure in the MERGESORT process
  MERGE(A,p,q,r)
  n1 = q-p+1
  n2 = r-q
  for i = 1 to n1 do
      L[i] = A[p+i-1]
  for j = 1 to n2 do
      R[j] = A[q+j]
  L[n1+1] = inf
  R[n2+1] = inf
  i=1, j=1
  for k = p to r do //you could also write n1+n2 , but the solution might be different, try it out
      if L[i]<=R[i] then
            A[k] = L[i]
            i = i+1
      else
            A[k] = R[j]
            j = j+1  
```    
## Loop invariant
    At the beginning of each iteration of the for loop , the subarray A[p..k-1] , should have k-p smallest elements of L[1..n1+1] and R[1..n2+1], in sorted order
    After this we can just make sure that each iteration goes through the loop , making sure that the initialization, Maintenance and Termination steps are correct

    To see that the MERGE procedure runs in‚ time Θ(n), where n = r-p+1, observe that each of lines 1–3 and 8–11 takes constant time, the for loops of lines 4–7 take ‚Θ(n) and there are n iterations of the for loop of lines 12–17, each of which takes constant time

# MERGESORT
  Then we apply MERGE() to the MERGESORT process
  if p>=r , then exit , as the number if elements is 0 or 1 , and there are no elements to sort
  A very good demo is at : https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms/merge-sort/a/overview-of-merge-sort
```C++
    MERGESORT(A,p,r)
    if p<q then
      q = floor((r+p)/2) // why not r-p , because q is an index midway of p and r
      MERGESORT(A,p,q)
      MERGESORT(A,q+1,r)
      MERGE(A,p,q,r)
```
### Recursion
  When an algorithm contains a recursive call to itself, we can often describe its running time by a recurrence equation or recurrence, which describes the overall running time on a problem of size n in terms of the running time on smaller inputs.

  **`Answer`**
  - Rewriting the merge procedure only, for not having the sentinel cards instead just using the logic to reach the end of the array and then copy the rest of the other array into the main array

  ```C++
  MERGE(A, p , q, r)
    n1 = q-p+1
    n2 = r-q

    // create the two temporary Left and the Right array
    for i = 1 to n1 do
      L[i] = A[p+i-1]

    for j = 1 to n2 do
        R[i] = A[q+j]

    // initialize     
    m=1
    n=1
    count_array = 1

    for k = p to r do
      if (m<=n1 and n<=n2) then
        if (L[m]<R[m]) then
          A[k] = L[m]
          m++
        else
          A[k] = R[n]
          n++
        count_array++

    // dump the array that is still not reached its end
    if(m<=n1) then
      for val1 = 1 to (n1-m+1) do
        A[count_array+val1] = L[m+val1-1]

    if(n<=n2) then
      for val2 = 1 to (n2-n+1) do
        A[count_array+val2] = L[n+val2-1]

##Technique for guessing solutions to recurrences

    – Write out tree of recursive calls
    – Each node gets assigned the work done during that call to the procedure (dividing and combining)
    – Total work is sum of work at all nodes

## Pseusdocode For binary Search for a Sorted Array
 - Finding the worst case running time for this Pseudocode
 - Below we are dividing and comparing , so dividing a n = 2^i , will take lg(n)
 - T(n) = O(lg(n))
 - No we cannot use Binary search for Insertion sort to reduce much time , it might reduce the number of comparisons , but still we will need to shift the left side elements to the key to the right and that is linear

```C++
// Array A , Value to search v
// f & l are the first and the last index respectively
Binary Search(A, f, l, value)
  if (f<l) then
    n = (f+l)/2
    if v = A[n] then
      return n
    else if v>A[n] then
        Binary Search(A, n, l)
    else if v<A[n] then
        Binary Search(A, f, n)  
```

    return (-1)      

// Algorithm ie , Θ(n lg(n))
  A = MERGESORT(S)

  for i = 1 to n do
    if Binary Search(A, first, last, x-s[i])!= NIL then
      return true // may be return the index i also
    else

```  

## problem 2.1

  a. Worst case time : **[n/k]kˆ2 = Θ(nk)**
  b. Solve this using the a = (n/k) . where T(n) = c(k)(a)lg(a) , considering the fact that there are "a" sublists and then they are finally broken down into a*k*c values
  c. Let's solve this using C++ and Python to see the comparisons and find the value of k , based on the comparisons
