**Notes :**  
  - graph set is represented as : G = (V,E) [Both directed and un-directed]
  - For representing graphs the most important criteria is the
  - The maximum number of edges = O(n^2)

    **adjancency matrix**
      - What is to be used , a adjancency matrix or a Adjacent list
      - adjancency matrix occupies n^2/8 (8 bits = 1byte)
      - adjancency matrix of a undirected matrix is always symmetric
      - for a graph G D .V; E/, we assume that the vertices are numbered 1,2...j |V| j in some arbitrary manner. Then the
        adjacency-matrix representation of a graph G consists of a |V|x|V| matrix, A=(a[i][j])
      - The Adjacent matrix of a un-directed graph is a transpose to itself
      - These are simpler as they require 1 bit per entry only and they are fixed time complexity of O(n^2)  

    **adjancency list**
      - adjancent list occupies 8e (where e = number of edges)
      - When making a adjacent list, it consists of array of vertices, each of which contains a list of all adjacent vertices (in an arbitary order)
      - For each u in set V , the adjancency list Adj[u] which will contain all the vertices in set V such that for a there is an edge (u,v) in set E
      - We treat Adj as an attribute of graph G, so we will see notation as G.Adj[u], as adjancency lists represent edges of the graph
      - For a directed graph, the sum of the lengths of all adjancency list is the set |E| , if un-directed it is 2|E|
      - Space complexity / memory  = Θ(V+E)

  - A Sparse graph is a graph that as the name indicates loosely connected (ie, trees). usually the number of edges is in O(n) where 'n' is the number of vertices . Here we prefer a Adjacent list as we required constant space for every edge . The number of edges is much less than the maximum number of edges
  - A Dense graph is a graph that is densely connected . Hence the number of edges is usually O(n^2) . Here we prefer a adjacent matrix .


## 22.1-1

    For a adjancency List
      - out of degree = Θ(E+V)
      - in degree = Θ(EV)

    For a adjancency matrix
      - Out of degree = Θ(V^2) //scanning each row
      - In degree = Θ(V^2) //scanning each column

 - Before doing this problem it is important to know what is a Binary Tree.
 - Understand the working and the types of Binary tree
 - create a Python Code for a Binary tree and perform some operations on the tree to be more clear

## Binary Tree
### Also use the definitions present at wikipedia
  - A binary tree is made of nodes , where each node contains a "left" reference, a "right" reference, and a data element
  - The topmost element is called a root
  - Tree is used to store information that naturally form a hierarchy, file-system
  - Trees provide moderate insertion and deletion [faster than arrays]
  - A Tree whose elements have at most 2 children is called a binary tree
  - The size of the Binary tree is the number of internal nodes

    ### A binary heap is a complete binary tree which satisfies the heap ordering property
  - min heap property : The property when the value of each node is greater than or equal to the value of the parent
  - max heap property : The value of each node is less than or equal to the value of its parent, with the maximum-value element at the root

# 22.1-2
  - considering a Binary heap (min)
  - The rows are the nodes
  - The columns are the leaf nodes

    1 0  1  1  0  0  0  0
    2 0  0  0  1  1  0  0

# 22.1-3
  - You have been given a Directed graph G = (V, E) and Gᵀ = (V, Eᵀ)
  - Describe efficient algorithms to compute Gᵀ
  - http://www.personal.kent.edu/~rmuhamma/Algorithms/MyAlgorithms/GraphAlgor/graphIntro.htm
  Running time of the algorithms for computing Gᵀ from Gᵀ
    - For Adjacency-list representation , it will always be Θ(E+V)
    ```Python
    Gᵀ = {}
    for u in V[G]:
      for j in adj[u]:
        if len(Gᵀ[j])!=0:
          Gᵀ[j].append(u)
        else:
          Gᵀ[j] = u  
    ```
    - For adjacency-matrix representation, it will be Θ(V²)

# 22.1-4
  - given a Multigraph G=(V, E), describe an O(V+E) time algorithm to compute the adjacency list
  - using the Multigraph present here : https://proofwiki.org/wiki/Definition:Multigraph
  - A Multigraph is a  graph that can have more than one edge between a pair of vertices, but u≠v , they do point to themselves
  - The new Edge set consists of replacements of multiple edges into one and with all self-loops removed
  - For n number of vertices we have a total of nC2 , total number of edges
  - For most cases, the graphs are sparse where the E<V*log(V) , if the number of edges is very near to E<V*log(V) , it will be a dense graph

    B -> C (2*2) -> D
    C -> D (2)
    D -> E (2)
    E -> F (3*2)
    ```
### solution
    - Go through each of the vertex u in V
    - Go through each of the edges and the number of edges are the total number of operations that we need
    - O(E) is the actual time taken

# 22.1-5
      - A square of the directed graph is such that for any (u,v) , there are only at most two edges between u and v
      - Algorithm to compute G²
      - For G² , the number of vertices are the same as G always
      - (u,w) belongs to E², iff there exists v in V , where (u,v) in E & (v,w) in E as well, that is there is a path of exactly two edges

**Adjacency-list representation**
      - v in V
      - Adj[u] is the list of all the edges , basically has all the v's to which u is the neighbor
      - Below code shows the algorithm takes O(n³)
      - https://github.com/gzc/CLRS/blob/master/C22-Elementary-Graph-Algorithms/22.1.md
      - Interesting thing here is , we would need to consider the looped lists for each vertex where u , v , w are all in V
      - The square of a directed graph G = (V, E) is the graph G² = (V, E²) such that (a, b) belongs E² if and only if for some vertex c belong V, both (u,c) and (c,b) belong E. That is, G² contains an edge between vertex a and vertex b whenever G contains a path with exactly two edges between vertex a and vertex b.
```C++
G-square(V[G], E[G])
V[G²] = V[G]
for u in V[G]:        
  for v in Adj[u]:
    for w in Adj[v]:
      E[G²]<-{(u,w)} U E[G²]
```
**Adjancency Matrix representation**
        - We can check in constant time ie,O(1) , if there exists a intermediate v such that (u,v) and (v,w) exists
        - There are at most "n" number of vertices to check , and n² pair of vertices to
        - Below code shows the algorithm takes O(n³)
```C++
// computing basically G*G Given G[n][n]
square(G)
for i = 1 to n do
  for j = 1 to n do
    G²[i][j]=0
    for k = 1 to n do
      G²[i][j] = G²[i][j] + G[j][k]*G[k][j]
      if G²[i][j] >= 1:
        G²[i][j] = 1
```

## 22.1-6

```C++
// if a adjacent matrix is already given then find the sink node in the matrix with only O(n) time
#include <iostream>

int sink(int* G, int i)

int ssink(int G[][], int i)
  for j = 1 to V:
    if G[i][j] == 1 then
      return false
    if G[j][i] == 0 and j!=i then
      return false
  return true

i=0
j=0
 do {
  if G[i][j] == 0 then
      j++;
  else if G[i][j] == 1 then
      i++;
} while(i<n and j<n);

if (i<n and issink(G,i)) then
  cout<<"The Sink is :"<<i;
else if i>n then
  return -1;
```

### Incidence matrix
 - Based on the graph G , we have the such that
 - for the code please refere to the github repo :

    **B[i,j]** =
    {
              (indegree + outgree) , if u = v
              -(edges connecting u and v) , if u!=v
              0 , otherwise
    }

  ```Python
  [[-1  0  1 -1  0]
  [ 1 -1  0  0  0]
  [ 0  1 -1  0  1]
  [ 0  0  0  1 -1]]
product
  [[ 3 -1 -1 -1]
  [-1  2 -1  0]
  [-1 -1  3 -1]
  [-1  0 -1  2]]
  ```

### Solution

  - Now when we want to search for an item, we simply use the hash function to compute the slot name for the item and then check the hash table to see if it is present. This searching operation is O(1). O(1), since a constant amount of time is required to compute the hash value and then index the hash table at that location.
  - The mapping between an item and the slot where that item belongs in the hash table is called the hash function. The hash function will take any item in the collection and return an integer in the range of slot names, between 0 and m-1. Assume that we have the set of integer items . Our first hash function, sometimes referred to as the “remainder method,” simply takes an item and divides it by the table size, returning the remainder as its hash value
  - The issue will be with collision , if two inputs to the hash function maps to the same slot name (or table index)
  - BST -> binary search tree will be an Alternative DS , they are ordered or sorted and will take less time for search

| algorithm      | Average        | Worst case |
| :------------- | :------------- |:------------- |
| search         | O(log n)       | O(n)          |
| insert         | O(log n)       | O(n)          |
| delete         | O(log n)       | O(n)          |
