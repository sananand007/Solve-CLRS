## Chapter-22

  - graph set is represented as : G = (V,E) [Both directed and un-directed]
  - For representing graphs the most important criteria is the
  - The maximum number of edges = O(n^2)

    **adjancency matrix**
      - What is to be used , a adjancency matrix or a Adjacent list
      - adjancency matrix occupies n^2/8 (8 bits = 1byte)
      - adjancency matrix of a undirected matrix is always symmetric
      - for a graph G D .V; E/, we assume that the vertices are numbered 1,2...j |V| j in some arbitrary manner. Then the
        adjacency-matrix representation of a graph G consists of a |V|x|V| matrix, A=(a[i][j])
      - The Adjacent matrix of a un-directed graph is a transpose to itself
      - These are simpler as they require 1 bit per entry only and they are fixed time complexity of O(n^2)  

    **adjancency list**
      - adjancent list occupies 8e (where e = number of edges)
      - When making a adjacent list, it consists of array of vertices, each of which contains a list of all adjacent vertices (in an arbitary order)
      - For each u in set V , the adjancency list Adj[u] which will contain all the vertices in set V such that for a there is an edge (u,v) in set E
      - We treat Adj as an attribute of graph G, so we will see notation as G.Adj[u], as adjancency lists represent edges of the graph
      - For a directed graph, the sum of the lengths of all adjancency list is the set |E| , if un-directed it is 2|E|
      - Space complexity / memory  = Θ(V+E)

  - A Sparse graph is a graph that as the name indicates loosely connected (ie, trees). usually the number of edges is in O(n) where 'n' is the number of vertices . Here we prefer a Adjacent list as we required constant space for every edge . The number of edges is much less than the maximum number of edges
  - A Dense graph is a graph that is densely connected . Hence the number of edges is usually O(n^2) . Here we prefer a adjacent matrix .


## 22.1-1

    For a adjancency List
      - out of degree = Θ(E+V)
      - in degree = Θ(EV)

    For a adjancency matrix
      - Out of degree = Θ(V^2) //scanning each row
      - In degree = Θ(V^2) //scanning each column

 - Before doing this problem it is important to know what is a Binary Tree.
 - Understand the working and the types of Binary tree
 - create a Python Code for a Binary tree and perform some operations on the tree to be more clear

## Binary Tree
### Also use the definitions present at wikipedia
  - A binary tree is made of nodes , where each node contains a "left" reference, a "right" reference, and a data element
  - The topmost element is called a root
  - Tree is used to store information that naturally form a hierarchy, file-system
  - Trees provide moderate insertion and deletion [faster than arrays]
  - A Tree whose elements have at most 2 children is called a binary tree
  - The size of the Binary tree is the number of internal nodes

    ### A binary heap is a complete binary tree which satisfies the heap ordering property
  - min heap property : The property when the value of each node is greater than or equal to the value of the parent
  - max heap property : The value of each node is less than or equal to the value of its parent, with the maximum-value element at the root

# 22.1-2
  - considering a Binary heap (min)
  - The rows are the nodes
  - The columns are the leaf nodes

# 22.1-3
  - You have been given a Directed graph G = (V, E) and Gᵀ = (V, Eᵀ)
  - Describe efficient algorithms to compute Gᵀ
  Running time of the algorithms for computing Gᵀ from Gᵀ
    - For Adjacency-list representation , it will always be Θ(E+V)
    - For adjacency-matrix representation, it will be Θ(V²)

# 22.1-4
  - given a Multigraph G=(V, E), describe an O(V+E) time algorithm to compute the adjacency list
  - using the Multigraph present here : https://proofwiki.org/wiki/Definition:Multigraph
  - A Multigraph is a  graph that can have more than one edge between a pair of vertices, but u≠v , they do point to themselves
  - The new Edge set consists of replacements of multiple edges into one and with all self-loops removed
  - For n number of vertices we have a total of nC2 , total number of edges
  - For most cases, the graphs are sparse where the E<V*log(V) , if the number of edges is very near to E<V*log(V) , it will be a dense graph

    ```
    A -> B (2)
    B -> C (2*2) -> D
    C -> D (2)
    D -> E (2)
    E -> F (3*2)
    ```
### solution
    - Go through each of the vertex u in V
    - Go through each of the edges and the number of edges are the total number of operations that we need
    - O(E) is the actual time taken

# 22.1-5
      - A square of the directed graph is such that for any (u,v) , there are only at most two edges between u and v
      - Algorithm to compute G²
      - For G² , the number of vertices are the same as G always
      - (u,w) belongs to E², iff there exists v in V , where (u,v) in E & (v,w) in E as well, that is there is a path of exactly two edges

**Adjacency-list representation**
      - v in V
      - Adj[u] is the list of all the edges , basically has all the v's to which u is the neighbor
      - Below code shows the algorithm takes O(n³)
      - https://github.com/gzc/CLRS/blob/master/C22-Elementary-Graph-Algorithms/22.1.md
      - Interesting thing here is , we would need to consider the looped lists for each vertex where u , v , w are all in V
```C++
G-square(V[G], E[G])
V[G²] = V[G]
for u in V[G]:        
  for v in Adj[u]:
    for w in Adj[v]:
      E[G²]<-{(u,w)} U E[G²]
```
**Adjancency Matrix representation**
        - We can check in constant time ie,O(1) , if there exists a intermediate v such that (u,v) and (v,w) exists
        - There are at most "n" number of vertices to check , and n² pair of vertices to
        - Below code shows the algorithm takes O(n³)
```C++
// computing basically G*G Given G[n][n]
square(G)
for i = 1 to n do
  for j = 1 to n do
    G²[i][j]=0
    for k = 1 to n do
      G²[i][j] = G²[i][j] + G[j][k]*G[k][j]
      if G²[i][j] >= 1:
        G²[i][j] = 1
```
