## Chapter-22

  - graph set is represented as : G = (V,E) [Both directed and un-directed]
  - For representing graphs the most important criteria is the
  - The maximum number of edges = O(n^2)

    **adjancency matrix**
      - What is to be used , a adjancency matrix or a Adjacent list
      - adjancency matrix occupies n^2/8 (8 bits = 1byte)
      - adjancency matrix of a undirected matrix is always symmetric
      - for a graph G D .V; E/, we assume that the vertices are numbered 1,2...j |V| j in some arbitrary manner. Then the
        adjacency-matrix representation of a graph G consists of a |V|x|V| matrix, A=(a[i][j])
      - The Adjacent matrix of a un-directed graph is a transpose to itself
      - These are simpler as they require 1 bit per entry only and they are fixed time complexity of O(n^2)  

    **adjancency list**
      - adjancent list occupies 8e (where e = number of edges)
      - When making a adjacent list, it consists of array of vertices, each of which contains a list of all adjacent vertices (in an arbitary order)
      - For each u in set V , the adjancency list Adj[u] which will contain all the vertices in set V such that for a there is an edge (u,v) in set E
      - We treat Adj as an attribute of graph G, so we will see notation as G.Adj[u], as adjancency lists represent edges of the graph
      - For a directed graph, the sum of the lengths of all adjancency list is the set |E| , if un-directed it is 2|E|
      - Space complexity / memory  = Θ(V+E)

  - A Sparse graph is a graph that as the name indicates loosely connected (ie, trees). usually the number of edges is in O(n) where 'n' is the number of vertices . Here we prefer a Adjacent list as we required constant space for every edge . The number of edges is much less than the maximum number of edges
  - A Dense graph is a graph that is densely connected . Hence the number of edges is usually O(n^2) . Here we prefer a adjacent matrix .


## 22.1-1

    For a adjancency List
      - out of degree = Θ(E+V)
      - in degree = Θ(EV)

    For a adjancency matrix
      - Out of degree = Θ(V^2) //scanning each row
      - In degree = Θ(V^2) //scanning each column
