## Asymptotic complexity and Growth of Functions

**3.1-1**

 **`Answer`**

    Present and done in writing .
    RTP: max(f(n) , g(n)) = Θ(f(n)+g(n))

    *Required to prove := c1(f(n)+g(n)) <= max(f(n) , g(n))  <= c2(f(n)+g(n))*

    gist :
        f(n) and g(n) are Asymptotic positive and increasing hence at any point
        f(n) <= max(f(n),g(n))
        g(n) <= max(f(n),g(n))
..... Adding both
        [f(n)+g(n)]/2 <= max(f(n),g(n)) ---1
        max[f(n),g(n)] <= f(n)+g(n)     ---2 --> this since they are Asymptotic increasing
**Combining both the equations** , we will get the above, with c1 = 0.5 and c2 =1

**`Answer`**

  - Solved in Paper mostly
  - There will be tons of algorithms that will be growing slower than O(n²) , so saying that the running time of an algorithm A is growing faster than n² means nothing as there will be a number of algorithms better than and slower order
