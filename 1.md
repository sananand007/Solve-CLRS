**1.1-1**
Give a real-world example that requires sorting or a real-world example that requires computing a convex hull.

**`Answer`**
>During Fencing of a set of animals, you would need to create a convex hull. A convex hull is the smallest convex polygon containing the points. Intuitively, the convex hull is what you get by driving a nail into the plane at each point
and then wrapping a piece of string around the nails. More formally, the convex hull is the smallest
convex polygon containing the points.

implement using C++/Python(scipy)

**1.1-2**
Other than speed, what other measures of efﬁciency might one use in a real-world setting?

**`Answer`**
>Memory usage and Power

**1.1-3**
Select a data structure that you have seen previously, and discuss its strengths and limitations.

**`Answer`**
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list

Linked Lists

**strengths**
  - Insertion and deletion of Nodes easily (allocating and de-allocating of Memory while program is running)
  - Dynamic Data structures such as stacks
  - No requirement of initializing a linked Lists
  - Backtracking a two way LL is possible
  - Items can be removed and added easily in a LL

**Disadvantages**
  - They use more memory than arrays, as they use pointers
  - Nodes in a LL must be read from the beginning as LL are sequential access
  - Difficulties arise when traversing the linked lists backward , singly ll are cumbersome to navigate backwards and for doubly linked lists are somewhat easier to read , but more space is consumed for a back-pointer

**1.1-4**
How are the shortest-path and traveling-salesman problems given above similar? How are they different?

**`Answer`**
 - shortest-path does not require you to travel through every point and come back to the same point, They are similar as the final aim is to do something (traverse) with least effort

**1.1-5**
Come up with a real-world problem in which only the best solution will do. Then
come up with one in which a solution that is “approximately” the best is good
enough.

**`Answer`**
 - Best Solution - Finding out whether a disease is Fatal or not
 - approximately - Finding the best path for a graph algorithm or any two points as such, best effort will do

 **1.2-1**

 **`Answer`**
  - Google Search , needs algorithms of Pattern and text recognition at the application level

 **1.2-2**

  - solve for n<8*log(n),gets [n>2^(n/8)] , or n>43

 **1.2-3**

  - n=15, n, cannot be 0. For 100n^2 < 2^n

**1-1** Comparizion of running times

  - All the values here are computable , we just need to compute as below
  - for t=1sec, lg n = 10^6*(1) , n = 2^(10^6)
